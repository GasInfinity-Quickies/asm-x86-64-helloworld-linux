# Hello world in x86_64 intel syntax assembly
Just a simple program to review my assembly knowledge and relearn what I don't remember

## Build instructions

Install: `nasm`
(And `gcc`, but almost every linux distro has it)

That's it, you only need to `sh build.sh` and the binary will be in `out/hello.x86_64`
